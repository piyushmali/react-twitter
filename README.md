# React Twitter DApp 🐦💻

Welcome to the **React Twitter DApp** project! This is the frontend part of the Twitter smart contract project, allowing users to interact with a Twitter-like platform built on the Ethereum blockchain using Web3 and React. 🚀

## Overview 🌟

The React Twitter DApp mimics the core features of Twitter in a decentralized application. Users can connect their Ethereum wallet, create a profile, and post tweets. The tweets are stored on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring immutability and decentralization. 🌐

## Features ✨

- **User Authentication** 🔐: Connect your Ethereum wallet to interact with the DApp.
- **Profile Creation** 👤: Create and manage your user profile.
- **Tweet Posting** 📝: Post tweets which are stored on the blockchain.
- **Tweet Listing** 📜: View and sort tweets by timestamp.
- **Responsive Design** 📱: User-friendly and responsive UI.

## Setup Instructions 🛠️

To get started with the React Twitter DApp, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** 🧬:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/piyushmali/react-twitter.git

   ```

2. **Install dependencies** 📦:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server** 🚀:
